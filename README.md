# Full stack developer assignment

## Objectives

The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate a strong understanding of frontend frameworks and proficient utilization of backend APIs as a full-stack developer. Our goal is for you to highlight your problem-solving abilities and creative thinking.

## Project

1. Set up a node API server based on the provided images and articles data.
1. Create an API endpoint (/images) that retrieves a list of all the images in the images directory and associates each image with an article from the articles list inside the data directory.
1. Develop a web application using a framework of your choice (we use Nuxt but feel free to use something else) and create a page to display the images.
1. Use the provided [attached reference design material](https://www.figma.com/file/9LTf63sbWsf2VwiST524uJ/test?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design) as a guide to creating a responsive mosaic layout with a group of cards. The material provided is for reference only, however, it should be as close as possible in terms of implementation.
1. Populate each card with data fetched from your API server endpoint(/images).
Imp1. lement a hover effect on each card to display the associated articleâ€™s title and description.
1. Add a button to allow users to upload new images. When the button is clicked, prompt the user to select an image to upload.
1. Save the uploaded image to the images directory in the API server and display the newly uploaded image on the same page.


## My troubles
I cannot create a responsive mosaic layout with a group of cards as shown in the Figma design material and it breaks when new items are added.
